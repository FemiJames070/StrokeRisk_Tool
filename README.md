## üìå Introduction

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. Early detection of high-risk individuals can improve outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and save lives.  

The **StrokeRisk Application** uses **machine learning** to predict stroke risk from demographic, lifestyle, and medical data. Built with the **CRISP-DM** methodology and grounded in **responsible AI principles**, the application features:

- **Accurate Predictions** ‚Äì Ensemble of top-performing ML models.
- **What-if Analysis** ‚Äì Explore preventive scenarios.
- **Interpretability** ‚Äì SHAP-based feature explanations.
- **Ethical & Human-Centered Design** ‚Äì Fairness monitoring, transparency, and usability focus.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Business Understanding

**Problem Statement:**  
Develop a scalable, data-driven clinical decision support tool to help healthcare professionals identify high-risk patients before stroke onset.

**Scope:**  
Predict stroke risk using patient demographic and medical data.

**Value Proposition:**  
Identify 80% of high-risk patients earlier than current methods, potentially reducing stroke-related readmissions by 15%.

**Stakeholders:**
| Stakeholder           | Role                 | Interest                                |
|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Healthcare Providers  | Frontline users      | Early detection, patient prioritization |
| Hospital Admins       | Oversight            | Reduce readmissions, cut costs          |
| Data Science Team     | Model builders       | Maintain accuracy and reliability       |
| IT Team               | Deployment           | Secure, scalable integration            |
| Patients              | End beneficiaries    | Preventative care access                |
| Public Health Agencies| Population health    | Scale prevention programs               |
| Insurance Providers   | Risk managers        | Lower claims via early intervention     |

**Business Goals:**
- Detect ‚â•80% of high-risk patients early.
- Reduce stroke-related readmissions by 15%.
- Improve care efficiency with patient prioritization.
- Enable data-driven prevention strategies.
- Build a scalable AI framework for broader health risk prediction.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Understanding

**Source:** Public stroke dataset (`stroke.csv`) with demographic, lifestyle, and medical history.

**Key Features:** Age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, smoking status, glucose levels, work type, marital status, residence type.  
**Target Variable:** `stroke` (binary: 1 = Yes, 0 = No).  

**Challenges:**
- Class imbalance (~5% stroke cases).
- Missing BMI values.
- No temporal/geographic data.

**Findings:**
- Strong correlation: Age, hypertension, glucose levels.
- Moderate: Smoking status, marital status.
- Weak but relevant: Work type, residence type.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation

- **Missing Values:** Median imputation by age group for BMI.
- **Encoding:** One-hot encoding (`drop_first=True`).
- **Scaling:** `StandardScaler` after SMOTE.
- **Class Imbalance:** SMOTE to 50:50 ratio.
- **Split:** 80/20 train-test with stratification.
- **Ethics:** Retained ambiguous entries, logged preprocessing steps.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Modeling & Evaluation

**Models Tested:**
- Random Forest (Best overall accuracy ~0.96)
- XGBoost (Strong accuracy, unique feature insights)
- Extra Trees (Lowest false positives, balanced F1)
- LightGBM (Competitive but less stable)
- Decision Tree (Baseline, overfit)

**Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score, AUC-ROC, Confusion Matrix, Feature Importance.

**Deployment Choice:**  
Three-model ensemble (**Random Forest + XGBoost + Extra Trees**) plus a combined meta-model.  
Hyperparameter tuning showed no significant improvement.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Front-End & Human-Centered Design

Built with **Streamlit** using **Human-Centered Design** and the **Fogg Behavior Model (B=MAT)**.

**Key Principles:**
- **Motivation:** Clinical impact, trust, transparency (SHAP visualizations).
- **Ability:** Low friction (‚â§2 clicks), accessibility (WCAG-compliant).
- **Trigger:** Integration into patient intake and screenings.

**Main UI Pages:**
- **Landing Page** ‚Äì Quick access CTAs.
- **Patient Data Entry** ‚Äì Guided form.
- **Risk Assessment** ‚Äì Probability, category, contributing factors.
- **Records Management** ‚Äì CRUD operations.
- **Practitioner & Patient Profiles** ‚Äì Overview of key data.
- **Model Performance** ‚Äì Metrics & fairness indicators.
- **System Settings** ‚Äì Thresholds, preferences.
- **Data Privacy & Consent** ‚Äì Notification & consent controls.
- **Help & Support**, **Contact Us**, **About Us**.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment

**Version Control:** Git + GitHub.  
**Hosting:** Streamlit Cloud.  
**Database:** SQLite (future: scalable DB).  
**Security:** Encryption (GDPR, PHIPA, HIPAA compliance), role-based access.

**Backend Models:** Ensemble model with option to view individual model predictions.

**Monitoring & Feedback:**
- **Performance Drift:** EvidentlyAI.
- **Fairness Audits:** Scheduled subgroup checks.
